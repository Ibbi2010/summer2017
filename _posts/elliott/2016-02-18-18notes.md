# Remote Class

For this class you're reading the notes and watchig the videos ahead of time, then working for at least 40 minutes with a partner via video during our normally scheduled class time.  Treat this as you would any collaboration with a colleague in class - be on time, be helpful, and do your best to use your tools like video chat and github effectively.  This situation mimics an increasingly common professional scenario where your teammates don't live in your city.  At Trinket, for instance, we're currently working extensively with German, Dutch, and Californian collaborators and have a biweekly video call with a partner in the UK.

# In-class remote exercise

This is the first time we've done this so please work together to make it go as smoothly as possible!  At our scheduled class time, find your partner in our class chat room and complete the [in-class exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/milestones-inclass.html).
