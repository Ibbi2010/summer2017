# Q & A

* Turtle **state**
* What's the deal with `return`?
* Where do **variables** exist?

With both of these, our text doesn't explain as much as [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) does; check that

win friends because of it.  And if the purpose for and audience of these hasn't quite sunk in yet, reading
other people's code is the best way for it to.
