# Q & A

* Turtle **state**
* What's the deal with `return`?
* Where do **variables** exist?

With both of these, our text doesn't explain as much as [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) does; check that
link for more info on **return values** and **scope**.  I'll now demonstrate the basics with your help.

# Questions & Answers

* Should you commit to the gh-pages branch?
* Should you merge your own pull requests?
* When do the magical 'Fixed #XXX' or 'Fixes XXX' words work?


# Peer Code Review

This is where those of you who have been commenting, reflecting, and pull request titling will
win friends because of it.  And if the purpose for and audience of these hasn't quite sunk in yet, reading
other people's code is the best way for it to.

* Review & merge your partner's PR (opening issues if there are any)
* View their live post on the site (merge any PRs they need to do to get the post to display)
* Fill out the [Turtle Peer Review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Aypxuw5S-z8tYizuAzdjFD9ws5NHRKE4sKZCqU6JiUk/viewform) form.]
* Submit
* Discuss with your partner
* Group up & compare notes.  Show off the partner you reviewed's code to the group
* What did you you learn?
* Show off a partner's work in front of class

# Next Time

Lots of work over the break!  Pace yourself.  Start early.  We've got to keep going so we don't fall behind.

* Chapter 5 reading & exercises.  We'll *finally* go over loops!  Woot.
* Chapter 6 reading & exercises.  **Strings** aka text.  Super fun.
* Chapter 8 reading & exercises.  Loops
* Recommended: Automate the Boring Stuff Lists and loops.

Why cram all these together?  Well, they're related.  Loops are loops **over** a list.  The familiar `range(4)` produces a list.  `for i in range(4)` produces the list `[0,1,2,3]`, assign each of them to `i` and completes the code in the for block.

Strings are just lists of characters, with additional methods (like `.format()` and `.contains()`) built in for our convenience.

So, it's a lot of material, but doing it over a long weekend should help it all sink in.
